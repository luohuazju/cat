New Web Framework

I try to design and implement a web MVC framework myself. I take some reference from turbine. 

It is designed to provide many different stores based on one code base.

The purposes for this framework is that we can rapidly deliver a lot of similiar online stores for different brands. For example, the mobile web online stores. They are different, but most of the functions and pages are similar, so this framework can allow you to share one code base, and this framework also allow you to customized the functions and pages as you like.
